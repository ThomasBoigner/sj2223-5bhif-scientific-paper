= Authentication with Spring Security

Simply adding the Spring Security dependency will force the users to authenticate through an autogenerated login form to access any page of our application.

== Customizing Spring Security
To customize the Spring Security settings we need to define and register a SecurityFilterChain bean. For our project the SecurityFilterChain looks like this:

[source, java]
----
include::../../main/java/at/spengergasse/sj22235bhifpos1scientificpaper/config/SecurityConfig.java[tags=SecurityFilterChain]
----

=== Specifying which pages need authentication to access
For the login the most important parts are the authorizeHttpRequests, formLogin and logout sections, we will talk about the other parts later. The authorizeHttpRequests method works like an Access List, because it starts with the first statement and only if it doesn't match it executes the second one. It is recommended to define the pages everyone has access to, with .requestMatchers().permitAll() first and then define that any other page needs authentication with anyRequest().authenticated(). With this configuration every new page needs to be explicitly made available for everyone, this prevents pages that should be private from accidentally being available for everyone. You can also use hasRole() instead of using permitAll() to specify pages only admins have access to for example. We will set up HasRole() to check if the roles collection in the user entity contains that role later.

=== Customizing the login
With formLogin() we can customize the login process. With .loginPage() we can set the login endpoint to one of our controllers that returns our custom login page:

[source, java]
----
include::../../main/java/at/spengergasse/sj22235bhifpos1scientificpaper/presentation/www/AuthenticationController.java[tags=login-endpoint]
----

And here is the custom login page:

[source, html]
----
include::../../main/resources/templates/login.html[lines=12..30]
----

This form sends a http post request to /perform_login, the same endpoint we defined earlier with .loginProcessingUrl("/perform_login"). .defaultSuccessUrl() defines the endpoint users will be redirected to after logging in and .failureUrl() defines the url that the user will be redirected to if the login failed because of a wrong email or password.

=== Customizing the logout

We can customize the endpoint a http get request has to be sent to, to log out any users with .logoutUrl() and specify the endpoint users will be redirected to with .logoutSuccessUrl(). .deleteCookies will delete the cookie that holds the session id.
